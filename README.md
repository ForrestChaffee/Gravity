# Uncertainty of Prediction
1. I could use extensions that replicate random outcome to create a code that replicates the travel of photons like that seen in the double slit experiment
2. I could mimic the outcome of the forces three bodies have on one another over time through eulers method then find out how innacurate it becomes over time
