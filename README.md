# Uncertainty of Prediction (Title)
**Summary**  

There are many ways of inserting physics into coding languanges. There are many tests that have been done that one can compare the accuracy of ones code results to.

**Background**

This can be used as review of prior and current classes and help with gaining a further understanding of the scope and degree of codings applicability.

**Resources** 

Python, it's extensions, what others have done with them, and what I have done with them can all be used.

**Objectives**  

1. I could use extensions that replicate random outcome to create a code that replicates the travel of photons like that seen in the double slit experiment.
2. I could mimic the outcome of the forces three bodies have on one another over time through eulers method then find out how innacurate it becomes over time.
