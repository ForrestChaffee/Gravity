# Uncertainty of Prediction (Title)
**Summary**
There are many ways of inserting physics into coding languanges. There are many tests that have been done that one can compare ones code results to. 
**Background**
This can be used as review of prior and current classes and help me gain a further understanding of the scope and degree of codings aplicability.
**Resources**
None as of yet.
**Objectives**
1. I could use extensions that replicate random outcome to create a code that replicates the travel of photons like that seen in the double slit experiment
2. I could mimic the outcome of the forces three bodies have on one another over time through eulers method then find out how innacurate it becomes over time
